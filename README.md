# Welcome to 🏜Desert Ipsum🏜

## Created by Luca Morellato

Little Project I worked on using Gatsby and Typescript. Love letter to my favourite journal/podcast [Desert Oracle](https://www.desertoracle.com/) and all the arid lands of the world. Site is hosted using Gatsby Cloud and currently lives [here](https://desertipsum.gatsbyjs.io/).

Hope you enjoyed it. Feel free to ping me if you wanna chat deserts, existential dread or about your last UFO sighting.
